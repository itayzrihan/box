# 🚀 BOX Project

Welcome to your BOX Framework application! This is a fully functional starter template with examples showing how to:

- Build **reactive components** with state management
- Create **API endpoints** (backend routes)
- Use **component composition** with `<include />`
- Develop with **instant hot-reload** (HMR)

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Visit **http://localhost:3000** and start building!

## 📁 What's Inside

- **`src/main.box`** - Your app's entry point
- **`counter.box`** - Interactive component with state (learn reactive updates!)
- **`api-demo.box`** - Calling API endpoints from the frontend
- **`api+hello.box`** - Backend API route example
- **`learning-guide.box`** - Comprehensive guide to vibe coding with BOX

## 🎯 Development Workflow

1. Edit `.box` files in `src/`
2. Save and browser auto-refreshes
3. See your changes instantly (no build step needed!)
4. Use `npm run build` for production

## 📚 Learn More

Each `.box` file is heavily commented with tips on:
- ✨ Reactive state management with `Box.state`
- 🔌 Two-way binding with `box-bind="propertyName"`
- 📡 API integration and fetching
- 🎨 CSS scoping and component encapsulation
- 🚀 Production builds and deployment

Check out **`learning-guide.box`** for a complete tutorial!

## 🤖 AI-Friendly Code

Copy any `.box` file into Claude, ChatGPT, or your favorite AI assistant.
The pure HTML/CSS/JS structure makes it perfect for AI-assisted development.
